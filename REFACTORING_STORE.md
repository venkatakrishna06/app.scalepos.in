# Store Refactoring

## Changes Made

1. **Removed `store.ts`**
   - Deleted the `src/lib/store.ts` file which was previously just re-exporting everything from `./store/index.ts`
   - All imports from `@/lib/store` now directly resolve to `src/lib/store/index.ts`

## Why This Change Was Made

The `store.ts` file was redundant as it only served as a pass-through to the modular store architecture in the `store/` directory. By removing it:

1. **Simplified Import Resolution**
   - TypeScript now resolves imports from `@/lib/store` directly to `store/index.ts`
   - This eliminates an unnecessary level of indirection

2. **Cleaner Architecture**
   - The codebase now directly uses the modular store architecture
   - This is more aligned with the project's goal of having a clean, modular codebase

3. **No Breaking Changes**
   - All existing imports from `@/lib/store` continue to work without modification
   - TypeScript's module resolution automatically finds `index.ts` in the `store/` directory

## Impact

This change has no functional impact on the application. It's purely a refactoring change to improve code organization and maintainability.

All components that previously imported from `@/lib/store` will continue to work exactly as before, but now they're importing directly from the modular store architecture.
