# Web to Desktop Application Conversion Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to convert the QuickQuick Restaurant Management System from a web application to a desktop application using Electron.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies Added
- **electron**: The core Electron framework
- **electron-builder**: For packaging the Electron application
- **concurrently**: To run multiple commands concurrently during development
- **vite-plugin-electron**: Vite plugin for Electron integration
- **vite-plugin-electron-renderer**: Vite plugin for Electron renderer process

### 2. Configuration Files Modified

#### package.json
- Added Electron main process entry point: `"main": "electron/main.js"`
- Added Electron-specific scripts:
  - `"electron:dev": "concurrently \"vite --host\" \"electron .\""`
  - `"electron:build": "vite build && electron-builder"`
  - `"electron:preview": "vite build && electron ."`
- Added electron-builder configuration for packaging the application for different platforms

#### vite.config.ts
- Added Electron plugins
- Set base path to `./` for relative paths in the built application

### 3. New Files Created

#### electron/main.js
- Main Electron process file
- Sets up the main browser window
- Handles window lifecycle events
- Sets up IPC communication

#### electron/preload.js
- Preload script for the renderer process
- Exposes a limited API for IPC communication
- Sets up event listeners for communication

#### DESKTOP_APP.md
- Documentation for installing and running the desktop application

### 4. Code Changes

#### src/App.tsx
- Changed from `BrowserRouter` to `HashRouter` for better compatibility with Electron
  - HashRouter uses the hash portion of the URL for routing, which works better with file:// URLs

### 5. Documentation Updates

#### README.md
- Added Electron to the list of technologies used
- Added a section about the desktop application with installation and usage instructions
- Added a link to the DESKTOP_APP.md file for more detailed information

## Running the Desktop Application

### Development
```
npm run electron:dev
```

### Building for Distribution
```
npm run electron:build
```

### Previewing the Built Application
```
npm run electron:preview
```

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Thoroughly test the desktop application on different platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
2. **Customization**: Add platform-specific features and optimizations
3. **Auto-updates**: Implement an auto-update mechanism for the desktop application
4. **Offline Support**: Enhance offline capabilities for the desktop application
5. **Native Features**: Integrate with native desktop features like notifications, file system access, etc.
