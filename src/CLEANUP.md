# Code Cleanup and Standardization

This document summarizes the changes made to clean up the codebase and ensure it follows the best practices established during the recent refactoring efforts.

## Changes Made

### 1. Store Architecture Updates

- **Updated Store Index**: Added exports for `useRootStore` and `useAuthStore` to the barrel file (`src/lib/store/index.ts`) to ensure all stores are available through a single import.
- **Simplified Store.ts**: Replaced the large monolithic store file with a simple re-export file that maintains backward compatibility while encouraging the use of the modular store architecture.

### 2. Component Architecture Updates

- **Dashboard Component**: Refactored the large dashboard.tsx file (860 lines) to use the specialized components created during the refactoring:
  - `DashboardHome`: For the home view
  - `DashboardOrders`: For the orders view
  - `DashboardTakeaway`: For the takeaway order view
  
  This reduced the file size to just 34 lines and improved maintainability.

### 3. Centralized Toast System

Updated all components to use the centralized toast system from `@/lib/toast` instead of importing directly from 'sonner':

- UserManagement.tsx
- UserCreationForm.tsx
- menu-item-form.tsx
- payment-dialog.tsx
- table-management-dialog.tsx
- table-reservation-dialog.tsx
- view-orders-dialog.tsx
- categories.tsx
- menu.tsx
- orders.tsx
- reservations.tsx
- staff.tsx
- tables.tsx
- auth/login.tsx
- auth/signup.tsx
- customers.tsx

This ensures consistent error handling and toast messages throughout the application.

### 4. Cross-Store Dependencies

Verified that all cross-store dependencies are using the root store for proper store composition, eliminating the use of hacky approaches like accessing the global store through `window.__ZUSTAND_DEVTOOLS_STORE__`.

## Benefits

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Smaller, focused components are easier to understand and maintain.
2. **Consistent Error Handling**: All components now use the centralized toast system for consistent error messages.
3. **Better Store Architecture**: The modular store architecture with proper store composition makes the code more maintainable and easier to extend.
4. **Reduced Code Duplication**: Reusing specialized components reduces code duplication and ensures consistent behavior.
5. **Better Performance**: Proper memoization and component splitting reduces unnecessary rerenders.

## Future Recommendations

1. **Continue Component Splitting**: Identify and refactor any remaining large components into smaller, focused components.
2. **Add Store Persistence**: Implement persistence for relevant stores (auth, settings, etc.) to improve user experience.
3. **Improve Error Handling**: Add more comprehensive error handling with fallback UI for critical components.
4. **Add Tests**: Add unit tests for the refactored components and stores to ensure they work correctly.
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Add performance monitoring to measure the impact of the refactoring and identify any remaining performance bottlenecks.
